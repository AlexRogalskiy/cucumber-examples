cucumber-jvm-parallel-template
=======================

CucumberJVM template project for running tests in parallel. 

This project was based on [Selenium-Maven-Template](https://github.com/Ardesco/Selenium-Maven-Template) and support for CucumberJVM was added
## How to run:
 1. One "Runner" class per thread (use profile `parallel`). By "Runner" class is meant *RunCukesCheeseTest* class in this example.
    * **NOTE** - in order to use this approach, you will need to create separate "runner" class per one thread. Tests belonging to one "runner" class will be executed sequentially.
    * More on this read [here](https://opencredo.com/running-cucumber-jvm-tests-in-parallel/).
 2. Using [cucumber-jvm-parallel-plugin](https://github.com/temyers/cucumber-jvm-parallel-plugin) (use profile `parallelPlugin`)
    * *cucumber-jvm-parallel-plugin* will automatically generates "runner" classes.

### Command for execution
```
mvn clean verify -P [nogrid OR grid],[parallel OR parallelPlugin] -Dthreads=[number of parallel threads]
```

* *parallel* - when using separate "runner" class per one thread
* *parallelPlugin* - uses cucumber-jvm-parallel-plugin. Automatically creates separate "runner" class per one thread
* *nogrid* - execute tests locally
* *grid* - execute tests on Selenium Grid. Grid Hub can be set in pom by using `seleniumGridUrl` property or in ApplicationProperties file 
* Thread count can be set via `-Dthreads` argument

For example, invoking 
```
mvn clean verify -P parallelPlugin,nogrid -Dthreads=3 -Dbrowser=chrome
``` 
will execute tests in parallel 3 threads on local machine and using *cucumber-jvm-parallel-plugin* plugin. In addition, `-Dbrowser` setting will set browser to Chrome.

### Reporting
Reports are generated by [maven-cucumber-reporting](https://github.com/damianszczepanik/maven-cucumber-reporting) plugin and can be found under *target/site/cucumber-reports/cucumber-html-reports*
